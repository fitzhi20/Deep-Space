	<p class="red-text">“Exploring any place beyond Mars wouldn't be possible,” Batcheldor said.“The time scale says a trip from Earth 
	to Jupiter and back would take the lifetime of a human,” he said...<br>But it's not going to be possible unless we will 
	be able to travel the speed of light – which we will not.</p>

    <h class="blue-text">Temperature</h><br>
	<p class="red-text">The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang,<br> is 2.7 kelvins (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F)</p>
	
	
  <h class="blue-text">Fear</h>
   
    <p class="red-text">Astrophobia is a severe and irrational fear of stars and space. It is one of the specific phobias that are related to a <br>defined object or situation. 
	For many, astrophobia is strongly connected to a fear of aliens.</p>
 <h class="blue-text">Danger</h3>
   <p class="red-text">The environment of space is lethal without appropriate protection: the greatest threat in the vacuum of space derives 
   from the lack of oxygen and pressure,<br> although temperature and radiation also pose risks. The effects of space exposure
   can result in ebullism, hypoxia, hypocapnia, and decompression sickness</p>

	<h class="blue-text">How far away is Voyager 1 now?</h>
    <p class="red-text">22 billion km,Voyager 1 has overtaken all other spacecrafts and is now the most distant: 22 billion km away, pulling<br> 
    away from the slightly slower Voyager 2 at “only” 18.8 billion km distant.</p>
	<h class="blue-text">Will Voyager 1 leave the Milky Way?</h>
    <p class="red-text"> Thousands of years from now, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 will leave our solar system.<br>
	But their instruments will stop working long before that happens</p>
	<h class="blue-text">How long would it take Voyager to reach Alpha Centauri?</h>
    <p class="red-text">The nearest star, Alpha Centauri, is 4.37 light-years away, which equals to 25 trillion miles. Even NASA's Voyager 1 space probe –<br>
    which became the first spacecraft to exploit interstellar space back in 2012 – would take 70,000 years to get there going 10-miles-per-second.</p>
	<P class="red-text">In 56,000 years, Voyager 1 will exit the Oort cloud, then brush by the stars GJ 686 and GJ 678 in 570,000 years</p>
	<hr>
	<h class="blue-text">Voyager 2</h>
	<p class="red-text">15 kilometers per second Voyager 1 is traveling faster, at a speed of about 17 kilometers second (38,000 mph),<br>
	compared to Voyager 2's velocity of 15 kilometers per second (35,000 mph). In the next few years, 
    scientists expect Voyager 2 to encounter the same kind of phenomenon as Voyager 1</p>
	<p class="red-text">On November 5, 2018, Voyager 2 officially left the solar system as it crossed the heliopause,<br> the boundary that marks the end 
	of the heliosphere and the beginning of interstellar space.</p>
	<hr>
	<h class="blue-text">Summary</h>
	<p class="red-text">NASA said that the successful call to Voyager 2 is just one indication that the dish will be fully back online as planned in February 2021. ...<br> Both Voyager 2 and Voyager 1 have traveled well beyond their original destinations. The spacecraft were built to last five 
	years and conduct close-up studies of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
